### 👋 Hi, I'm Markus.
I'm a software developer and technology enthusiast from Osnabrück, Germany. My passion is building digital services and implementing own ideas. In addition to my main job I use every free minute to implement my own project, called beSporty. To compensate my computer time I do daily sports 💪 and eat much fast food. 🍕
